       "0  GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. But Venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . Venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  Zeid Ra ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. He said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. Last month, Zeid s office said Venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  There is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  Zeid said. The opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. However, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum:  We have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.    The opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. Arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home-made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30.  Our country is now at peace,  he added. Venezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. Diego Arria, who was Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  I am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  Julieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  There is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event.    \n",

I think everyone understands that there is still much work for negotiators to do even if the European Council decides to move into phase two of Brexit negotiations,  German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news conference on Friday.

A Texas Sheriff shocked an MSNBC host when he discussed how he prepares local teachers to be armed in the classroom. common sense solution? You betcha!Sheriff Paul Cairney of Argyle, Texas, described the process by which staff members can carry firearms in the school district. The Sheriff said that the staff at the school who choose to carry a firearm go through an intense round of interviews and training before they are allowed to carry on campus. The MSNBC host was flabbergasted at the practice and asked the Sheriff about concerns for the safety of the students in the school when there are firearms around.Sheriff Cairney:  The time to do nothing is over THE PROCESS TO BECOME A SCHOOL MARSHALL:To become a school marshal, those employees must undergo extensive active shooter and firearms training with the state. They must also undergo a mental health evaluation. They receive a school marshal designation by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement and must renew their license every two years by undergoing the same training and evaluation. Outside of campuses in Keene and Argyle, signs warn visitors that there are staff members who are armed and are prepared to protect children.   \n",

The two were abducted on Feb. 8 while delivering assistance in Jawzjan province, in the north of the country, on the border with Turkmenistan.  Six of their colleagues were killed in the attack, which prompted the ICRC to suspend operations in Afghanistan for a time.  We are relieved and grateful that our colleagues are now back with us unharmed, the ICRC head of delegation in Afghanistan, Monica Zanarelli, said in a statement. At the time of the attack, officials in the area blamed Islamic State gunmen but the ICRC said it would not comment on the identity of the abductors, their motives or details of the release. Kidnapping has been a major problem in Afghanistan for many years. Most victims are Afghans abducted for ransom but foreigners or Afghans working for foreign organizations have also been targeted.    \n",

       "      <td>GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. But Venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . Venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  Zeid Ra ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. He said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. Last month, Zeid s office said Venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  There is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  Zeid said. The opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. However, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum:  We have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.    The opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. Arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home-made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30.  Our country is now at peace,  he added. Venezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. Diego Arria, who was Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  I am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  Julieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  There is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event.</td>\n",

The MSNBC host was flabbergasted at the practice and asked the Sheriff about concerns for the safety of the students in the school when there are firearms around.Sheriff Cairney:  The time to do nothing is over THE PROCESS TO BECOME A SCHOOL MARSHALL:To become a school marshal, those employees must undergo extensive active shooter and firearms training with the state. They must also undergo a mental health evaluation.

Six of their colleagues were killed in the attack, which prompted the ICRC to suspend operations in Afghanistan for a time.  We are relieved and grateful that our colleagues are now back with us unharmed, the ICRC head of delegation in Afghanistan, Monica Zanarelli, said in a statement. At the time of the attack, officials in the area blamed Islamic State gunmen but the ICRC said it would not comment on the identity of the abductors, their motives or details of the release. Kidnapping has been a major problem in Afghanistan for many years. Most victims are Afghans abducted for ransom but foreigners or Afghans working for foreign organizations have also been targeted.</td>\n",

       "'GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. But Venezuela s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as  baseless . Venezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship.  My investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,  Zeid Ra ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. He said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. Last month, Zeid s office said Venezuela s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was  barely alive .  There is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,  Zeid said. The opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. However, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum:  We have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens  will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.    The opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,  he said. Arreaza accused protesters of using firearms and  home-made weapons  against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30.  Our country is now at peace,  he added. Venezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. Diego Arria, who was Venezuela s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.  I am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,  he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  Julieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued.  There is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,  she told the same event. '"
